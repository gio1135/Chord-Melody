# Chord-Melody
Learning to play a specific style on the guitar is a daunting task. There are two primary reasons for this. The first is that there is so much information to be digested with regard to music and playing a musical instrument. It is difficult to know ahead of time what pieces of information are immediately important to your particular goals. This sifting process has been the reason a lot of people get forever sidetracked from their initial vision. It takes a person who has already made the journey to where you want to be to filter all the available information and feed to you in bite-sized pieces that you can comprehend. Unfortunately, by the time such a person has made this journey, they will have probably forgotten how confusing the initial steps were. You will learn from such a person, but you may have that nagging feeling that you are not really going in the direction you had hoped for.

This paper is really a chronicle of the author's own journey written in such a way as to allow other people to follow the same path. The information in this paper can be considered as a set of markers similar to those that hikers may place along a trail so they can find their way back again. In this case, the author kept a running account so he could be sure he was not going in circles and getting lost in the wealth of information. To this end, only that information regarding music theory that seems appropriate for the focus of this paper is presented. Also, such information is presented as a set of heuristics for building scales and chords. All the information discussed in this paper is available in greater detail elsewhere. The value added by this paper is simply the distillation of the available information into a practical guideline to get guitarists started with chord-melody arranging and playing.

Originally, I thought that it would be both fun and profitable to write a computer program for teaching this material. As I got farther along, I changed my mind. The material presented here is really "head" stuff (memorizing by repetition and understand by doing). I truly feel that the fewer distractions that come between the guitarist and this information, the better. If a person were to simply sit down with their guitar and the information contained in this paper every day for six months and honestly work through the material, they would gain a solid foundation for that most fascinating pursuit - chord-melody playing. By eliminating all the keyboarding and mouse clicking and distractions that accompany the computer, the guitarist can focus on the important issues.

I am not opposed to computer technology, having made my living as a software engineer for the past 15 years. However, I do not subscribe to the idea that computers can do everything. It was a result of working through this material that I changed my mind about writing a computer program to present this material. One part of me would love to do it. But, the guitarist in me says that would be too much clutter. In any case, I hope this material is helpful for getting you started playing decent chord-melody arrangements of your own making.

The material presented here is very focused on the chord-melody style of arranging and playing. If you thoroughly learn this material, you will have a solid basis for picking and choosing what you want to study next. With the wealth of material available (and the inherent lack of organization of this material), this added benefit will be very valuable.

The chord-melody style of playing the guitar refers to a way of playing that includes the melody, harmony, and (if played solo) the bass line all being played simultaneously on one instrument. This style is considered by many to be the most challenging and satisfying for guitarists. Any song or tune with a strong melody can be played this way. It has been the author's experience that people tend to listen to and enjoy arrangements of songs they know. This style lends itself well for those of us who choose not to sing.

Music has often been referred to as a language. Like languages for speech, different areas and disciplines of music have evolved their own vocabulary. The information presented here focuses on that music vocabulary peculiar to the discipline of chord-melody playing on the guitar. This paper will focus on the construction and use of chords for harmonizing melodies. The small amount of music theory presented here is intended solely to support the information regarding the construction of chords on the guitar fretboard. It is strongly advised that this information be approached in much the same manner as one would attend to learning a new language.

First, you would start with building a foundational vocabulary. On top of this foundation, you would add knowledge of sentence construction. From there, you would study modes of expression and variances on common usage. Eventually, you would want to reach a point of fluency such that you would not be required to carry a dictionary or grammar book with you to translate from your native tongue to the new language and back again. The new language would become as fluent for you as your native tongue. Such should be the case with this material. You can utilize the chord dictionary presented later in this paper to simply grab chords that fit your immediate need. Or, better still, you can make the chord dictionary available as a tool in a learning process that you may at a later point discard as the elements of this language become fluent for you as you speak the language of music.

Having only six strings to work with, it becomes readily apparent that there is quite a difference between straight music theory regarding chord construction and how this information applies to the guitar in real application. To this end, the paper will present both the formal list of chord spelling and a set of guidelines for applying these spellings to the guitar fretboard. These guidelines were gleaned from studying hundreds of chord forms and noting what could be construed as common practice for arriving at such forms.

This material takes the well-known CAGED system of approaching guitar chords and expands it into a large library of chord forms specific to the solo chord-melody style of guitar playing used by Johnny Smith, Joe Pass, Bucky Pizzarelli, and many others. If you follow all the sections presented here, you will arrive at the chord library with a good understanding of how the forms in it were constructed. You will have a systematic approach to fingerboard harmony that will help you to continue to grow as a musician far beyond what is presented here. Thoroughly understanding the CAGED system and systematically building the knowledge as a foundation for understanding the chord form library cannot be stressed enough. It is very important to acquire this knowledge and have it well in hand BEFORE utilizing the chord form library. If you do not do this, you will be simply going through the motions of mechanically selecting chord forms to fit melody notes.

This process without the knowledge will gain you nothing in the long run. If you really understand the underpinnings of how the chord forms were arrived at, you will be constantly seeing new ways to apply the forms because you will view differently than one who does not possess the requisite knowledge. Beyond this, you will (through this process) begin to acquire your own unique style as you find new ways to voice the chords. There is no easy, quick way to get to this place. If there was, everybody would be able to do it. All the journey requires is a method and determination to stick with it. This paper provides the method, but you have to provide the determination.

Fretboard harmony is a very rich and satisfying field of study with lots of room for experimentation and development of individual style. This is evidenced by the differences in the sounds created by the previously mentioned artists using the same six strings and fretboard.

If you wish to maximize your learning and progress, it is worthwhile to develop a daily regimen to make sure you get to know the basics of this system so well as to become second nature. To this end, a daily practice program is presented that is very efficient for mastering the fundamentals of the CAGED system. This program will take less and less time to go through as you become proficient at it. The knowledge gained from faithfully working through the program every day will open the world of fretboard harmony to you.

Note that The daily regimen presented will require you to work through two sets of chord forms. The first is the basic CAGED form set. The second is a set of four note chords that include either the major 7 or the dominant 7 (don't worry about these terms right now -- they will be explained later). The second set of forms grow out of the CAGED forms and provide a solid basis from which all the forms in the chord library (presented at the end of the paper) are derived. If you practice (and ultimately memorize) these forms using the method described for the daily regimen, you will soon be able to form the chords in the chord library without the use of this paper.

This set of exercises is not just busy work for mindless practice. You should be mentally active in your daily practice. When not at the guitar, practice visualizing the various components of these practice sessions. Athletes have long known and benefited from visualization. The purpose of the library of chord forms is to get you (in addition to the daily practice regimen) quickly into arranging chord-melody solos. It is only through practical application that you will get a good grasp on these forms. Therefore, the way to work this program is relatively simple:

Spend the first weeks (or months - depending on how much background you already have) getting VERY familiar with the practice regimen.

Progress to the chord form library and use it to create LOTS of chord-melody solos. This whole thing should become second-nature like speaking English to communicate with others. Music is, after all, a language we need to learn to speak it fluently to express ourselves.

Look to expanding your knowledge by studying other people's arrange- ments, method books, and recorded songs. All the while, continue practicing your daily regimen (it should take less than 10-15 minutes per day by now) and arranging new songs. By learning LOTS of new songs, you will get a natural feel for how chords progress.

At some point, you may want to learn to play and arrange by ear. To do this, become familiar with the major scales for each form. Each day, pick a song at random (start with simple nursery rhymes) and pick out the melody on the guitar. At first, this may be difficult. In time, as with everything else, it gets easier. By now, you already have a good feel for (if not memorized) the use of the chord forms in the library to create chord-melody arrangements. Use this knowledge to harmonize the melodies you pick out by ear.
## Daily Exercise Regimine
All 6 steps should be practiced every day. At first, this will take
a while (30 minutes - 1 hour). But, as you become familiar with the
territory (which is the whole idea), these will take less and less
time. With time, these can be completed within 10 minutes. These
exercises encapsulate the entire subject matter presented in this
paper. Becoming completely familiar and comfortable with the material
through these exercises will make the journey as painless as possible.
 
1. Pick any note at random (or, move through the cycle of
fifths, taking one of these each day).
2. Find each occurrence of this note along each string, going
up all strings, then back down.
3. Use this note as the root of today's chord to find
the basic CAGED forms going up and down the neck. With
each chord form, identify it's "nucleus" root, third, and
fifth.
4. For each chord found in step 3, play its Pentatonic and
major scale forms. [NOTE: plug this step into your daily
exercise regimen when you feel the need to do so -- and
will thus be motivated to do it].
5. For each of the chord forms identified in step 3, treat
that chord as the I chord and find it's nearest ii and
V7 chords (example: for a I chord of 'A', find the
Bmi(7) and E7 chords that are closest to the 'A' chord). Use the
chord form library to find these chord forms.
[NOTE:] Now is a good time to start becoming familiar with the
Pentatonic forms by playing each of these chord form's Pentatonic
scale. [SEE EXAMPLE ON NEXT PAGE]
6. Use the note selected in Step 1 as the melody note to be harmonized.
Find and play all the chords that would use that note as the 1, 3,
5, and 7th as the melody on the first and second strings. Start
with basic chord forms and expand to include minor chords, 6ths,
9ths, suspended, etc. Use the chord form library to find these
forms. See the section "A PRACTICAL CHORD-MELODY LIBRARY OF FORMS",
particularly showing how to "morph" from a basic CAGED form to one
of the library forms.
